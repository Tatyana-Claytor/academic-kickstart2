  Stranger Things Season 3 burst forth with the energy of a firecracker unrolling one of the show’s most terrifying seasons. The storyline builds up to a dramatic ending, highlighting an important theme of this season—the power of memory. *Spoilers ahead*

  On a hot summer’s day, Will is excited to be with his friends again, playing another intense game of Dungeons and Dragons. Though he tries hard to keep them engaged, Mike and Lucas are distracted by girl troubles while Dustin is missing altogether. When Will blows up in anger at their lackluster involvement, he storms off and goes to his childhood forest hut. He begins to reminisce while looking at photos from previous years which moves him to tears. Frustrated with losing his childhood, he destroys the hut.

  Billy who is easily the most hated human character in season 2 ironically becomes its most sympathetic. He is possessed by the Mind Flayer and used to bring captives to the monster. Since he is a violent person in the previous season, it’s hard to tell whether or not he hates what he is doing. In one scene, the kids have him trapped in a sauna, and he appears to be genuinely weeping about his actions. Shortly after though, he breaks the glass in the door, ready to attack Max, his sister.
